# Organization Management Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of Organization Management features for the SecKav security platform frontend, based on the backend API endpoints.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. **Organization Management Library** (`lib/organization.ts`)
- **Organization CRUD Operations**
  - Create new organizations
  - List user's organizations
  - Get organization details
  - Update organization settings
  - Delete organizations
- **Member Management**
  - Add organization members
  - Remove organization members
  - Role management (owner, admin, member)
- **Mock Data System**
  - Fallback implementation when backend is unavailable
  - Realistic data simulation

### 2. **Organization Management Page** (`/dashboard/organization`)
A comprehensive organization management interface with:

#### **Organization List**
- View all user's organizations
- Select organization to manage
- Create new organizations
- Organization quick access

#### **Organization Details**
- View and edit organization information
- Organization name management
- Creation date display
- Delete organization functionality

#### **Member Management**
- View all organization members
- Add new members with role selection
- Remove existing members
- Member role display
- Owner protection (cannot be removed)

### 3. **Integration with User Context**
- Organization information in user profile
- Organization-based access control
- Multi-organization support

### 4. **UI Components**
- Organization creation dialog
- Member invitation dialog
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Role selection dropdown
- Member list with role badges
- Loading states and error handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **API Endpoints Integrated**
```typescript
// Create organization
const result = await createOrganization({ name: 'My Org' }, token);

// Get user organizations
const orgs = await getUserOrganizations(token);

// Update organization
const updated = await updateOrganization(orgId, { name: 'New Name' }, token);

// Add member
const member = await addOrganizationMember(orgId, {
  email: 'user@example.com',
  role: 'admin'
}, token);
```

### **Type Definitions**
```typescript
interface Organization {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: string;
  ownerId: string;
  members: OrganizationMember[];
}

interface OrganizationMember {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'member';
  joinedAt: string;
}
```

## üîÑ Integration with Backend

### **Backend Requirements**
The frontend expects the following backend endpoints to be available:
- Organization endpoints at `/api/v1/organizations/*`
- Member management endpoints
- Proper error responses
- Role-based access control

### **Environment Variables**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Backend API URL
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### **API Endpoint Management** (Priority 3)
- Endpoint registration and discovery
- Endpoint configuration
- Policy assignment
- Endpoint analytics

### **Security & Firewall** (Priority 4)
- Firewall rules management
- Security events monitoring
- IP filtering and geo-blocking
- Security analytics

## üìã Testing

### **Manual Testing**
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/organization`
2. Create a new organization
3. Add and remove members
4. Update organization settings
5. Test role-based permissions
6. Verify responsive design

### **Backend Integration Testing**
1. Start the SecKav backend server
2. Test all organization operations
3. Verify member management
4. Test error scenarios

## üîí Security Considerations

- Role-based access control for organization operations
- Member removal protection for owners
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling and user feedback
